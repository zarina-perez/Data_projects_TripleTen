# TripleTen Sprint 2 Project - EDA

This is the 2nd project I worked on in the TripleTen Data Science program. This project was the most independent project I've worked on so far, and I loved it.

### Instacart Orders

The goal of the project was to clean the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers, including plot to help communicate the results.

#### The Data

The data was spread across five files:

- `instacart_orders.csv`: each row corresponds to one order on the Instacart app
    - `'order_id'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each order
    - `'user_id'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each customer account
    - `'order_number'`: the number of times this customer has placed an order
    - `'order_dow'`: day of the week that the order placed (which day is 0 is uncertain)
    - `'order_hour_of_day'`: hour of the day that the order was placed
    - `'days_since_prior_order'`: number of days since this customer placed their previous order
- `products.csv`: each row corresponds to a unique product that customers can buy
    - `'product_id'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each product
    - `'product_name'`: name of the product
    - `'aisle_id'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each grocery aisle category
    - `'department_id'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each grocery department category
- `order_products.csv`: each row corresponds to one item placed in an order
    - `'order_id'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each order
    - `'product_id'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each product
    - `'add_to_cart_order'`: the sequential order in which each item was placed in the cart
    - `'reordered'`: 0 if the customer has never ordered this product before, 1 if they have
- `aisles.csv`
    - `'aisle_id'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each grocery aisle category
    - `'aisle'`: name of the aisle
- `departments.csv`
    - `'department_id'`: ID number that uniquely identifies each grocery department category
    - `'department'`: name of the department

The data is provided by TripleTen, who took it from Kaggle and modified it.

#### The Process

I first explored the dataset to find and fix missing and duplicate values, and I merged DataFrames from different sources. Finally, I analyzed the data using visualizations and pivot tables.

### Results

Taking the time to explain my results at each step was a key element in this process, and this was my first attempt at doing it. I wrote an introduction and conclusion that outlined what I did, and made suggestions for Instacart to consider in the future.

Please have a look at the Jupyter Notebook included for a full description of results.
